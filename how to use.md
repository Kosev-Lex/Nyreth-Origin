Here are the instructions for how to use the Nyreth demo program:

It may take a while to boot up but when the gui opens, you'll see the
glyph universe with lots of nodes; 485 to be exact:

The Glyph Universe Canvas has a dynamic tkinter interface and features drag, hover metadata,
trace overlays, resonance rings, and layout persistence.

For some reason, my carefully crafted layout defaulted to the initial layout, where
everything is compressed together in a rectangular formation,
which means you will have to position the glyphs as you see fit. To do this,
individual glyphs can be selected and dragged (hold left button) or if you press
shift + left click, you'll see a drag box allowing you to select a whole cluster of 
glyphs that can be moved.

You can zoom in and out with the scroll but note, if you save the layout whilst zoomed
in, you will be unable to zoom out all the way. This is something that will be improved
in the next version. Once saved though, you are able to load your layout without issue.
For now, it's best to save layouts from a zoomed out perspective. You can also pan by
holding button 3.

If you press the 'Launch LLM' button:

It opens the pseudo LLM that has sample symbolic questions:

![gui7.jpg](how%20to%20use%20pics%2Fgui7.jpg)

You select one, run it, and Nyreth retrieves the enriched answer via a symbolic traversal process,
and it will show the trace pathway in the gui. Traces are stored and can be selected later:

![gui11.jpg](how%20to%20use%20pics%2Fgui11.jpg)

This answer would then be incorporated into the LLM response that is delivered to the user.
It's to demonstrate how the system could work in practice, so you can view output that shows
how the answer is derived.

Nyreth does not seek to replicate human cognition, but rather tries to realise a form of machine-native
thought based upon symbolic recursion, self-structured meaning and internal resonance.
