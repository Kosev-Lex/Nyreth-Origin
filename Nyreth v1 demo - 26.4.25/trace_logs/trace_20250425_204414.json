  "semantic_output": "In response to the query: What does it mean to grow past your former self?, the interpretation suggests themes of Symbolic undercurrent, Identity, gravity, recursive hub, and Synthesis, symbolic marriage, consonance, via recursive progressions like a symbolic transition between unknown glyphs. These symbolic elements combine to offer a perspective that deepens the original inquiry.",
