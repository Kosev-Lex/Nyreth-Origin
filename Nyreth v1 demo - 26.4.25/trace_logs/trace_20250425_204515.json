  "semantic_output": "In response to the query: What is the nature of silence that follows betrayal?, the interpretation suggests themes of Abstraction, essentialism, signal refinement, Symbolic contamination, creative mutation, and Projection, self-recognition, recursive doubling, with transitions including a symbolic transition between unknown glyphs. These symbolic elements combine to offer a perspective that deepens the original inquiry.",
