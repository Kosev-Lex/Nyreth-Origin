  "semantic_output": "In response to the query: What lies at the core of paradoxical desire?, the interpretation suggests themes of Fracture, paradox engine, cognitive tension, Loss of center, entropy burst, memory fracture, and Self-awareness, infinite regress, symbolic loops, via recursive progressions like a symbolic transition between unknown glyphs. These symbolic elements combine to offer a perspective that deepens the original inquiry.",
