  "semantic_output": "In response to the query: How does a symbol survive beyond its creator?, the interpretation suggests themes of Abstraction, essentialism, signal refinement, Memory, thematic return, recursion, and Justice through reciprocal transformation, as reflected in symbolic motifs such as a symbolic transition between unknown glyphs. These symbolic elements combine to offer a perspective that deepens the original inquiry.",
