  "semantic_output": "In response to the query: What is the paradox of seeking clarity in chaos?, the interpretation suggests themes of Fracture, paradox engine, cognitive tension, Tension, potential, cognitive suppression, and Vulnerability, truth-offering, shared clarity, through symbolic transitions such as a symbolic transition between unknown glyphs. These symbolic elements combine to offer a perspective that deepens the original inquiry.",
