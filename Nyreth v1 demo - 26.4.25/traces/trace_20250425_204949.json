  "semantic_output": "In response to the query: How do shadows form between people who were once close?, the interpretation suggests themes of Abstraction, essentialism, signal refinement, Doubt, buildup, suppressed motion, and Future recursion, delayed unfolding, via recursive progressions like a symbolic transition between unknown glyphs. These symbolic elements combine to offer a perspective that deepens the original inquiry.",
