  "compressed_insight": "Compressed Interpretation:\n→ Path Length: 4\n→ Dominant Glyphs: Elun, Elthorien (Meaning Leak), Ulven\n→ Key Motifs:\n   - Common progression: 'Treyl' → 'Olmeth' (x1)\n   - Common progression: 'Olmeth' → 'Syven' (x1)\n   - Common progression: 'Syven' → 'Ulvyn' (x1)\n→ Symbolic Themes:\n   - Abstraction, essentialism, signal refinement\n   - Symbolic contamination, creative mutation\n   - Projection, self-recognition, recursive doubling\n→ Compression Logic:\n   - Symbolic trace compressed by distilling dominant motifs, semantic fields, and recursive flows.\n   - Each glyph’s potential and connection frequency weighted to infer layered themes.",
  "semantic_output": "In response to the query: What is the nature of silence that follows betrayal?, the interpretation suggests themes of Abstraction, essentialism, signal refinement, Symbolic contamination, creative mutation, and Projection, self-recognition, recursive doubling, with transitions including a symbolic transition between unknown glyphs. These symbolic elements combine to offer a perspective that deepens the original inquiry.",
